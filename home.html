                <p>Youth employment rates (ages 15–29) for persons with disabilities show significant cross-country variation in 2022, from below 10% to over 40%. This disparity reflects not only differences in labour market structures but also varying levels of inclusive policies, accessibility infrastructure, and anti-discrimination enforcement—demonstrating that employment outcomes for persons with disabilities are policy-responsive.</p>

The gender gap persists across all disability categories, with women with visual disabilities at just 26.3% literacy.

                <p>This government chart displays Delhi's annual average Air Quality Index from 2018-2023, but uses inconsistent colors—2020 appears in purple while all other years are blue. This arbitrary color change creates visual confusion, making readers wonder if 2020 represents a different metric or category. While 2020 was anomalous due to COVID-19 lockdowns, the chart provides no explanation for the color distinction, violating the principle that color should encode meaningful information.</p>

By removing arbitrary color variations, the chart follows best practices: color should only be used when it encodes meaningful information. The uniform design allows readers to focus on the data trend—a gradual improvement in Delhi's air quality from 2018 to 2023.</p>
